# 参考CRA，和一些开源库搞搞脚手架

 [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
 [WEBPACK 5.X](https://webpack.docschina.org/guides/getting-started/#creating-a-bundle).

## 为啥要自己搞

实在受不了cra启动时太慢，craco写一轮脚本，要添加什么插件又还得看craco。各种rewrite。不行不行的。

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` （没有自动测试不好意思）

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
